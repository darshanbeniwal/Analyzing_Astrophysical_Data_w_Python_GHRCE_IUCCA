## [Two Days Workshop on Python Programming in Astronomy, Astrophysics & Cosmology](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/python-workshop/index.php)  
### Organized by Department of Applied Science, G H Raisoni College of Engineering, [GHRCE](https://ghrce.raisoni.net/python-workshop/index.php), Nagpur    
### Funded by Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics ([IUCAA](https://www.iucaa.in/en/))


I was among the invited speakers, along with Prof S. N. Hasan and Prof Priya Hasan, and in this repository, I have included all the files, including the data file and Python notebook, that were covered by me during two lecture sessions and four hands-on sessions.
