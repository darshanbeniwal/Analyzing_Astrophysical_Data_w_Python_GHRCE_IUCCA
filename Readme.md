## Two Days Workshop on Python Programming in Astronomy, Astrophysics & Cosmology  
### Organized by Department of Applied Science, G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur  
### Funded by Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA)

This workshop aims to bring a wide variety of people who use, develop or teach people about Python packages in the context of all forms of Astronomy. The workshop will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, and sprints. As well as building the community around astronomical uses of Python, the workshop aims to improve collaboration and interoperability between Python, packages, share knowledge on Python packages and techniques. It will also provide training and educational materials for users and developers of Python packages. The resource persons are well established faculty members in renowned institutes, all well versed with teaching skills. This workshop has been developed with unique approaches to convey information more efficiently and enable the visualization and applications of these research tools in Astronomy, Astrophysics & Cosmology.

I was among the invited speakers, along with Prof S. N. Hasan and Prof Priya Hasan, and in this repository, I have included all the files, including the data file and Python notebook, that were covered during the lecture sessions and four hands-on sessions.
