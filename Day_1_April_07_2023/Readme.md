## **Here are two options for working with Jupyter notebooks from this Github-Repository:**



### **1.** If you want to use these Jupyter Notebooks on your computer, please follow these instructions:  
- First, click on the Jupyter notebook that you would like to work on.  
- Once the notebook opens, you will see a link at the top of the file that says "Open in Colab".  
- If you prefer, you can edit or modify the file directly on Colab.  
- Alternatively, to use the notebook on your own computer, simply download the Jupyter notebook file from Colab by going to "File" and selecting "Download".  

### **2.** To download a single file from GitHub, you can use a tool called DownGit. Here's how:  
- Copy the link to the Jupyter Notebook that you want to download.  
- Go to DownGit, paste the link in the provided field, and hit "[DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home)".  
- The file will be downloaded to your computer for you to use.
