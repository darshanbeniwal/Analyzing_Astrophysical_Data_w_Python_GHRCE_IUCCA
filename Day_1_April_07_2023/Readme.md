### **1.** If you want to use these Jupyter Notebooks, please follow these instructions:  
- First, click on the Jupyter notebook that you would like to work on.  
- Once the notebook opens, you will see a link at the top of the file that says "Open in Colab".  
- If you prefer, you can edit or modify the file directly on Colab.  
- Alternatively, to use the notebook on your own computer, simply download the Jupyter notebook file from Colab by going to "File" and selecting "Download".
